## Daovation

Daovation is a crosschain Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO) platform that empowers users to create campaigns and raise funds for their dream projects or any cause they wish to support. The platform also incorporates a governance feature, allowing DAO members to create proposals that control the platform's content and make decisions, including taking down fraudulent campaigns through a voting system.
